# EUROCONTROL catalogue fetch
Fetches entries on the web EUROCONTROL product catalogue, and compares to PDF EUROCONTROL product catalogue.

## Wish list/To do
- Merge entries from web & catalogue based on URL match, so it goes : URL | web name | pdf name | web activity | pdf activity | ... etc.  
    - no duplicates if there's URL match  
    - no rows lost if there isn't a match or there's a mismatch somewhere  
- Highlight automatically where there is a difference or a match between web/pdf name,  web/pdf activity, etc  
- On additional sheets: group elements by activity, e.g. everything that's tagged CNS, whether that's in web or in PDF
